      <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">I am currently pursuing my diploma in Information Management at UiTM Rembau. This journey has been a meaningful and unforgettable experience for me. As a final year student, I feel a mix of emotions happy because I’ve come so far and grown so much, but also a little sad because this chapter of my life is coming to an end. Studying at UiTM Rembau has given me the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge, build lasting friendships, and develop both personally and academically. It has truly shaped who I am today, and I will always cherish the memories made throughout this journey.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;text-align: justify;text-justify:inter-word;">This is my elementry school , I began attending SMK Kg Baru Si Rusa when I was 16 years old. Unfortunately, my time there was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which limited many school activities and in-person learning experiences. Because of that, I didn’t have the chance to fully enjoy the typical school life, such as joining extracurricular activities, school events, or spending much time with classmates at school. Despite these challenges, I was still able to make new friends and slowly adapt to a new environment. Although the experience was different from what I expected, it taught me to appreciate the little moments and the importance of staying connected with others, even during difficult times.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Before I attended SMK Kg Baru Si Rusa,I go to SMK Seremban 3 for three years, from the age of 13 until I completed my PT3 examination. Although my time there was brief, it was filled with meaningful experiences and personal growth. The school, located in Seremban, is known for its dedicated teachers and vibrant student life. During my time there, I was actively involved in various co-curricular activities, including kawad kaki, bola jaring, and several other school programs. These experiences helped me develop teamwork, discipline, and confidence, which have shaped who I am today.</p>
